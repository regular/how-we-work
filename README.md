# how-we-work

- best practices
  - We produce production-ready code right from the beginning.
  - All code is automatically tested and immediately deployable.
  - Test-driven development and continuous integration are a given.
  
- agile
  - We work in teams of 2 to 4 full-stack developers.
  - We make extensive use of pair programming.
  - We work in sprints of 3 weeks.
  - After each sprint we have a full-day workshop (either in Berlin or via Skype) with you and the entire team.
  - After this workshop you decide how to continue.
  
- transparent
  - We use Github for version control. As a client you can follow our progress in real-time.
  - You will get to know each member of the team (but have a single contact person).
  - We openly discuss implementation options and help you define your goals.
  - we make heavy use of open source software whenever possible.
  
- risk-free
  - Knowledge about your project will be distributed among all team members. There is no specialised back-end, front-end or dev-ops person.
  - We start with a 1-week kickstart-sprint. If you don't like what you get after one week, you get your money back.
  - Otherwise you can book your first regular 3-week sprint.
  - Every three weeks you have the chance to re-adjust your goals based on your experiences with the growing product.
  
How much will it cost to make my product?

Honestly, we don't know. Nobody really knows. The problem with traditional software development is the immense hidden risk.
Software development has more in common with inventing than with construction. What we build for you will be unique and new.
Even though we have decades of experience, it is impossible to know exactly what problems we will encounter along the way. In fact,
_because_ of these decades of experience, we _know_ that there are surprises ahead. The only way around this would be to build something
that already exists.

The traditional approach to software production is very risky for you too. It requires that you identify every little detail about your product, every possible combination of user input, and put it into hundreds of pages of specification.
It is simply impossible to do this right. For anything more complex than the most simple of applications, an agile approach leads to way more satisfying results, happy developers and happy customers.

How does it work?

In a nutshell: You don't pay for results, you pay for development time. You book a team for one or more 3-week sprints. We make sure that the team members enjoy what we call _ideal development time_ during the period you payed for. That means: no distractions.
You can follow the progress they make on Github, but you can not directly interact with developers, except for your dedicated contact person. (This is part of _no distractions_).
When the sprint is over, the team presents their results to you. This is your opportunity to give feedback. Together we establish a plan for the upcoming sprint and set realistic goals for the next three week period.
You are in no way locked-in. After each sprint, you will have a production-ready application, and if you decide that it is good enough, you simply don't book another sprint. You can always come back later and we pick up where we left off.

To have a chance to convince you of our high standards and expertise, we offer a special kick-off sprint. Every new customer is entitled to this special offer. The kick-off sprint is just one week. If you don't like what you get after this first week of development, you get your money back (and obviously lose the right to use the code).
